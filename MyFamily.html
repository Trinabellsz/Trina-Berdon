	This picture was taken on my 18th birthday on April 25, 2022 in the terrace of our house which where my birthday is celebrated.
	We decorated the terrace with my favorite color: pink. Pink balloons and pink strips. Many people came to my birthday, aunts and uncles, and my friends. 
	There are also many ready meals and for the first time I have two birthday cakes from CaraMia: Salted S'mores and Strawberry Shortcake.

	<br>
	So let me introduce you my family ૮꒰ྀི⸝⸝> . <⸝⸝꒱ྀིა
	<br>
	On the far left is my kuya's wife and next to her is my biological mother then my auntie which I called my mommy. On the far right is my kuya,
	he is the son of my mommy and daddy. Though we're not biologically siblings, we treated each other like one. Then next to him is my uncle which
	I call my daddy, he's the husband of my mommy. For my biological father, he wasn't here because he's busy at work.

	This picture was taken on 2016 (I don't remember exactly when) but it is before we went to SM Bacoor for some bonding time with my father.
	Since my father is a domestic seaman, I don't always see him because he only comes home every December.
