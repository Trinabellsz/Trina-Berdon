			I downloaded this game last year (2022) out of my curiousity and thought it was fun when I first saw the ad at YouTube. I took the opportunity to
			try out this game since I got a new laptop. After I downloaded it, I enjoyed playing it even though I'm not a pro when it comes to shooting games.
			A couple days later, I found out one of my friends play this game and eventually 4 of my other friends joined in.

			I've been wanting to play this game since I saw it in the play store until my friends made me download bluestacks in my laptop to be able to play
			this mobile game. I started playing this game since August 3, 2022 and to this day, I'm still addicted to it. I love this concept of gingerbread
			cookies with their own unique designs and flavors, and they're also cute! I also love the lore the game has which made me stay much longer than
			any game I played lol.

					B.A.D 4 is my favorite fictional K-Pop band in CRK. They came out during the BTS x CRK crossover event on October 13, 2022, and January 19, 2023.
					They focused on taking over the world via music as the primary antagonists of the Heat of the Concert Story, hijacking the BTS Cookies' stage.
					They also made a song called "Bad and Dark."

			I discovered this game when I was looking for a Genshin Impact alternative game in early May 2023. I never played an anime game before, so downloading
			this game is a change of pace. At first, I felt uncomfortable since I'm not into anime, but eventually, I quite enjoyed it, especially the deep lore the
			characters have.

			<br>
			I chose the picture of High Cloud Quintet here. Teehee!

					Ever since I saw an ad featuring him on YouTube, I immediately fell in love. This guy is so badass when he fought Dan Heng in that ad.
					Still badass when he use his skill, talent, and ultimate.
					I like his story/lore since it was deep. He went through so many stuff in his life after he became immortal and mara-struck, I can't 
					blame him for being so cold. I sympathize him so much (｡>\\<)
					<br>

					He is also a member of the High Cloud Quintet when he was YingXing.
